# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to contribute!! There are a few ways to contribute like [filing](#looking-for-a-way-to-file-a-bug-or-request-a-feature) an issue or [working](#want-to-make-changes) on a ticket.

If you are making a contribution, then please make sure to follow the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

# Looking for a way to file a bug or request a feature?

- Create a new [idea discussion](https://github.com/heyjaywilson/peakfit/discussions/new?category=ideas) for a new feature
- Create a new [bug discussion](https://github.com/heyjaywilson/peakfit/discussions/new?category=bugs) for a new bug

@heyjaywilson will triage and make issues of these as needed

# Want to make changes?

Here's an over view of the process:

1. [Be assigned](#step-1-be-assigned-to-an-issue) an [issue](https://github.com/heyjaywilson/peakfit/issues)
2. [Fork the repo](#step-2-fork-the-repo)
3. [Commit your changes](#step-3-make-and-commit-your-changes)
4. [Open a pull request](#step-4-open-a-pull-request-and-make-it-pass) and make any changes as needed to get the Pull Request aproved
5. You're changes get merged in!

## Step 1: Be assigned to an issue

To make sure issues aren't being worked on by multiple people, issues will be assigned to whoever wants to work on them on a first ask basis.

All tasks can be found in Issues. If you're looking for one to work on, then check out this [view](https://github.com/heyjaywilson/peakfit/issues?q=is:open+label:%22ready+for+work%22+no:assignee). As long as no one is assigned and the issue is marked as "ready for work", then you can ask to be assigned to that issue..

## Step 2: Fork the repo

All changes to the codebase must happen through a pull request and the means you need to fork the repo to your own GitHub account.

### To fork the repository:

**Using the GitHub Command Line**

`gh repo fork heyjaywilson/peakfit --clone=true`

This will fork the repo and clone it to your computer at the same time

## Step 3: Make and Commit your changes

Make changes and commit as often as you need to. Make sure your commits are meaningfully described to give an idea as to what was done in the Pull Request.

> [!WARNING]
> Your commit messages must follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

## Step 4: Open a Pull Request and make it pass

Open a [new Pull Request](https://github.com/heyjaywilson/blueprint-app/compare).

- Pull requests **must** have a title that follows [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
  - This is enforced via a GitHub action and your PR will fail if it does not
- Pull requests **must** follow the template and [close](https://github.blog/2013-05-14-closing-issues-via-pull-requests/) the assigned issue

@heyjaywilson will make comments and those will need to be addressed in order to get the PR to fully pass.

## Step 5: Your changes get merged in!

After step 4, @heyjaywilson will more than likely merge your changes in ðŸŽ‰
